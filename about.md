Most people online call me **Byleth**. Nearly 30, I use masculine pronouns (he/him). Because it may be relevant to certain interpretations, I am both bisexual and a trans man.

This site is a collection of my thoughts, feelings, critiques, and woes about video games that I enjoy (or donâ€™t). I enjoy lore, so expect dives into world building and how the story intersects with the gameplay of any particular game.

I play a lot of *Final Fantasy XIV*... like... a *lot*. That will be my main focus, though other games may appear every so often. For instance, I'm also a big fan of *Drakengard*/*NieR*. You can find a list of games I've played or will play sometime in the future on [Backloggd](https://www.backloggd.com/u/stbyleth/).

You can find me on [the Fediverse](https://gamepad.club/@saintbyleth) or [Tumblr](https://capriciousvisage.tumblr.com/), though the latter is more personal and generally just is a bunch of art reblogs.

Feel free to reach out if you need anything.

**With love, Byleth**
